# LC-weather: Las Cruces Biological Station weather data

## General Notes: 

I started exploring Las Cruces weather data in January 2021, initially to support a project aiming to use digital images to quantify forest structure (obviously light-dependent)

## Data sources  


- OTS weather data are here: https://bixa.tropicalstudies.org/meteoro/default.php?pestacion=1

    - I downloaded the archived data for the historical data files:

            - January, 2005 to August, 2008. (Davis Station)  


- Rather than redownloading data, I obtained files for XXXX from Leland Werden.  

- Since February 2021 I have periodically downloaded data from https://bixa.tropicalstudies.org/meteoro/default.php?pestacion=1
